Please describe your problem.

Note: If you are wondering about missing icons, please double-check if the icon
is a pro icon on the Font Awesome website. It will say something like "Start
using this pro icon."

This package only includes the free icons by default. To use pro
icons, you must purchase a license and follow the instructions found in the
README.md file.
